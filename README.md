# About

This project is a customization of Raspi-Rollo[](https://github.com/bjwelker/Raspi-Rollo).
It does not use wiringPi.
I have implemented an alternative to wiringPi 'digitalWrite' function using libgpiod. 

## Usage

Use the 'sendv2' command to send the quadstate code. 
See Raspi-Rollo and its links for more details on the codes.
